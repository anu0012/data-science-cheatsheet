# A

## Accuracy - 
Accuracy is the measure of a classification model. It is a ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.

## Activation Function -
Activation functions are used to provide non-linear properties to the neural network. It is applied to the weighted sum of the inputs of a neuron in a neural network.

### What is the need of non-linearity - 
Neural-Networks are considered Universal Function Approximators. That's why we need an activation function which allows our model to approximate any function.

# F

## F1 Score - 
It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

F1 = 2\*precision\*recall / (precision + recall)

# P

## Precision - 
Precision is defined as the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false positives.

# R

## Recall - 
Recall is defined as the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives.
